Possum Kingdom is one of the parks that has been around the state park system for
a while. It's age is showing, but it is still nice park for a weekend getaway or 
a lake focused camping trip.

Getting to the park takes a bit of a drive. Don't count on a quick trip to a nearby
town for supplies or dinner, it's 17 miles from the enterance to the gate. There is
a small town on the other side of the lake, but it's a 30 minute drive around the
lake unless you have something to take you straight across.

When we pulled in the LOOP we were greeted by a small herd of deer grazing in the
open space. They observed us calmly, and continued their meal untill we started the
backing manuver into our campsite.

The sites in many of the loops are tightly spaced, and the back in pads in the LOOP
are too short for anything more than a 20 foot trailer. While we were in site 77 we
watched a family in a 30+ fifth wheel sucessfully manuver into a site just as long
as the trailer, leaving them no where to park their tow vehicle except on the edge
of the road.
