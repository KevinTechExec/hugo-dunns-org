As is traditional with new projects, first the Hello World. 

In this case, the project is a new record of adventures. Why a record? Becasue it's 2020 and
things just cant be strange enough for anyone. 

In all seriousness, there are some fun things that I am doing, some intresting things that Rebecca
and I discover, and I feel the need to have a place to put them. Things like brewing recipies,
camping sites, building projects, and the occasional cool technology thing that I discover and
want to share.

Building this out in Hugo for now - have been playing with Hugo and the Go language in general
lately so this seems like a good way to hone my skills. Expect the theme to change often as I
learn more about how Hugo works.

Enjoy.
