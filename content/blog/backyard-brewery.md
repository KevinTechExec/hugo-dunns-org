After brewing in the driveway for years it's time for a change. After much back and
forth I am relocating the brewery to the .... backyard.

This is a actually a bit more of a change than it might appear. At hear I am a social
brewer. I enjoy it when people walk up and ask "What's going on?" It gives me an 
opportunity to share some beer, talk about my brewing hobby, and meet the neighbors.

However, I can count on one hand how many times this has happened in the five years
I have been brewing. As much as it happens to my friends who live in more social 
neighborhoods it's not common here.

Add this to the fact that I want to get more into a woodworking hobby and swaping the
backyard shed where I have the tools for the fermentation and brewing equipment begins
to look like an attractive proposition. I have a grill cover that I can use to provide
cover to the boil kettle and the trees will make brewing in the Texas summer much more
comfortable.

Recently when I had power run to the shed the plan was to move the brewery, but I could
not get the idea of seperating the fridge that is the fermenter from the keezer. Walking
to the back of the backyard for a beer was declaired a non-started by the family.

However, in my new plan the keezer will stay in the garage. A small fridge that I had
used to grow yeast will get repurposed to a sourdough proofing chamber. The fermenter,
midsize fridge, and the kettles and burners will be relocated to the backyard shed.

This is going to trigger a number of builds of shelves, french cleat walls, and other
assorted projects. However I think in the end it will work out well. The big items
that would make this work well would be a sink and drain at the back of the yard.
That's going to take some work!
