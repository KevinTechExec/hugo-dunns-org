      <description>Hello World As is traditional with new projects, first the Hello World.
In this case, the project is a new record of adventures. Why a record? Becasue it&amp;rsquo;s 2020 and things just cant be strange enough for anyone.
In all seriousness, there are some fun things that I am doing, some intresting things that Rebecca and I discover, and I feel the need to have a place to put them. Things like brewing recipies, camping sites, building projects, and the occasional cool technology thing that I discover and want to share.</description>
